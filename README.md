## code

This repository contains daily coding exercises. I hope to do this every day. I will hold myself accountable!

I have divided the repo into 3 folders of code:

1. cpp - competitve programming related problems
2. ocaml - functional programming related problems
3. python - common interview problems, dp problems
4. go - go by example practices
5. R - R programming practices
6. tensorflow - tensorflow tutorials notes and programming

I will add more sections as I continue
