## code

This repository contains daily coding exercises. I hope to do this every day. I will hold myself accountable!

I have divided the repo into 3 folders of code:

1. cpp - competitve programming related problems
2. ocaml - functional programming related problems
3. python - common interview problems, dp problems

I will add more sections as I continue.
