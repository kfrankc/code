# Basic Operations and Numerical Descriptions

## Basic Operations

```
> a <- c(1,2,3,4)
> a
[1] 1 2 3 4
> a + 5
[1] 6 7 8 9
> a - 10
[1] -9 -8 -7 -6
> a*4
[1]  4  8 12 16
> a/5
[1] 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8
```
_Note_: when you do operations on vectors they are performed on an element by element basis. One ramification of this is that all the vectors in exp must be same length.

The `ls()` command will get a list of all the variables that have been defined.
