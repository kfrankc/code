# Recurrent Neural Network

RNNs are basically neural networks with loops in them, allowing them to pass information from one step of the network to the next.

We can think of RNNs as sequences of NNs (or lists of NNs). The special RNN that is often used to perform tasks such as speech recognition, language modeling, translation, and image captioning is LSTM. 

## LSTM Networks

Long Short Term Memory Networks are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies.
